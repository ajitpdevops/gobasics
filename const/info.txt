Constant Summary : 
- Immutable, but can be shadowed.
- Relacebale by the compiler at the compile time 
    - value must be calculated at compile time 

- Named like variables
    - PascalCase for exported Constants
    - camelCase for internal Constants

- Typed Constants work like imutable variable 
    - can interoperate only with the same type 

- Untyped constants work like literals 
    - Can interoperate with similar types

- Enumarated constants  
    - special symbol iota allows related constants to be created easily 
    - IOTA starts with 0 in each const block and increments by one 
    - Watch out of constant values that match zero values for variables.

- Enumerated expressions 
    - Operations that can be determined at compile time are allowed 
        - Arithmetic 
        - Bitwise operations 
        - Bitshifting
